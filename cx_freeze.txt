A note on using cx_Freeze to build executables from .py files:

cx_Freeze uses a setup script which contains the information it needs to build the executable. An example of such a script can be found in each of the script folders that are sub-folders of this one. 

The executable is built from this script by navigating to the folder containing the setup script in the windows command line and running the command "Python setup.py build"

The argument "build" tells python to compile and run the script, and the script's contents call the cx_Freeze modules that build the executable. 

More information can be found online in the cx_Freeze documentation.
